# NetLLM: Large Language Models for Network Management

## Project Overview

**NetLLM** represents a groundbreaking approach to telecommunications network management by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). This project aims to bridge the gap between complex network operations and intuitive natural language interactions.

### Key Objectives

- **Natural Language Network Configuration**: Enable network engineers to configure complex systems using plain English commands
- **Intelligent Fault Diagnosis**: Provide AI-powered troubleshooting through conversational interfaces  
- **Automated Documentation**: Generate comprehensive network documentation from operational data
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Use LLM reasoning for proactive network optimization

### Technical Innovation

Our approach combines:
- **Custom Fine-tuned Models**: Specialized LLMs trained on telecommunications domain knowledge
- **Real-time Network Integration**: Direct API connections to network management systems
- **Multi-modal Understanding**: Processing both text commands and network telemetry data
- **Safety & Validation**: Robust verification systems for critical network changes

## Development Journey

이 프로젝트의 개발 과정은 향후 일자별 개발 로그를 통해 문서화될 예정입니다. 각 포스트는 도전과제, 돌파구, 그리고 학습한 교훈들을 기록할 것입니다.

### Planned Development Phases

- **Phase 1**: Architecture & Planning 
- **Phase 2**: Data & Model Development  
- **Phase 3**: Interface & Integration 
- **Phase 4**: Testing & Optimization 
- **Phase 5**: Deployment & Evaluation 

*개발 과정의 상세한 기록은 곧 시작될 예정입니다.*
